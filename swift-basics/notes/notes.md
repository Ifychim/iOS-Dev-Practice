# **`Swift Deep Dive 1:`**

This deep dive covers basic topics of programming with Swift based on **`Swift5`**

-  **`Table of contents`:**
    - Naming Conventions
    - Commenting
    - String Interpolation    
    - Variables and Arrays
    - Constants
    - Range Operator and Randomization.

#### **`Naming Conventions`:**
A **`Dockerfile`** is a mechanism to automate the building of container images.
Building an image from a `Dockerfile` is a three-step process.
    1. Create a working directory
    2. Write a the `Dockerfile`
    3. Build the image with **`Podman`**.
