# **`Swift Deep Dive 1:`**

This deep dive covers basic topics of programming with Swift based on **`Swift5`**

-  **`Table of contents`:**
    - Naming Conventions
    - Commenting
    - String Interpolation    
    - Variables and Arrays
    - Constants
    - Range Operator and Randomization.

#### **`Naming Conventions`:**
In Swift5 camelCasing is the conventional method for naming variables and functions.

camelCasing Examples:
    1. weak var userNameVariable;
    2. func actionButtonFunction();

#### **`Commenting`:**
There are two types of method for commenting out code Swift5 (Single-Line comments, Multi-line Comment). 

Commenting Examples:
    1. To invoke a single-line comment we use '//' two forward-slashes.
    2. To invoke a single-line comment on a line you can use the command 'cmd + /' on the line you wish to comment out.
    3. To invoke a multi-line comment we use '/* */' forward slash and asterik.
    
```
print(" Hello")
```
#### **`String Interpolation`:**
String interpolation allows us to input bits of code between bits of text.
Commenting Examples:
    1. To invoke string interpolation we use '\()' back-slash followed by a set of parenthesis.
    
```
//This prints the addition of two integers in-between a string 
print("Two plus three is equals to \(2+3)")
```    


#### **Variables and Arrays** 
A **`Dockerfile`** is a mechanism to automate the building of container images.
Building an image from a `Dockerfile` is a three-step process.
    1. Create a working directory
    2. Write a the `Dockerfile`
    3. Build the image with **`Podman`**.
    
```
Code Block
``` 

#### **`Constants`:**
A **`Dockerfile`** is a mechanism to automate the building of container images.
Building an image from a `Dockerfile` is a three-step process.
    1. Create a working directory
    2. Write a the `Dockerfile`
    3. Build the image with **`Podman`**.
    
```
Code Block
``` 

#### **`Range Operator and Randomization`:**
A **`Dockerfile`** is a mechanism to automate the building of container images.
Building an image from a `Dockerfile` is a three-step process.
    1. Create a working directory
    2. Write a the `Dockerfile`
    3. Build the image with **`Podman`**.

```
Code Block
``` 

Done!
